# Privacy for individuals, not ICE

They show up in U.S. neighborhoods around the country dressed like a paramilitary organization--tactical vests, camouflage, and assault rifles--<a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/racial-profiling-by-ice-will-have-a-marked-impact-on-latino-communities/" target="blank>openly profiling minorities</a>, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/immigration-protest-arrests-detention-ice-8993bfd5d54b870521ec5b44fc42cd71" target="blank">illegally detaining and arresting U.S. citizens</a>, and <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/11/08/nx-s1-5585691/ice-facial-recognition-immigration-tracking-spyware" target="blank">scanning the faces</a> of anyone who might criticize or confront them.

And perhaps worst of all, they show up wearing masks or balaclavas, concealing their identity, and refusing to identify themselves when asked.

Since the start of the second Trump Administration--and particularly since the ramp up in operations in Minnesota--there has been a steady stream of disturbing videos showing ICE agents operating more like a shadowy guerilla snatch-and-grab organization rather than a federal immigration enforcement agency required to operate within the bounds of the constitution and laws.

In response, ICE efforts have been met with protests and disruptions. There have also been efforts to track their movements online and unmask ICE agents.

Now, in what is the largest leak of its kind, <a href="https://icelist.is/ target="blank">Ice List</a> has put out a list <a href="https://www.rawstory.com/ice-agents-data-leak/" target="blank">revealing the identities of some 4,500 ICE and Border Patrol employees</a>.

The leak comes just days after the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/10/us/rennee-good-ice-shooting-minnesota.html" target="blank">ICE shooting of Renee Good in Minneapolis</a> by a masked ICE agent, later <a href="https://www.wbur.org/news/2026/01/09/johnathan-ross-ice-killing-renee-good-minneapolis-background" target="blank">identified as Jonathan Ross</a>.

Predictably, the Trump Administration <a href="https://www.advocate.com/politics/trump-blames-renee-good" target="blank">has been quick to blame Good and others</a> for any complaints against ICE's operations while ramping up its enforcement actions.

While the Decent Project advocates for privacy rights, it believes those rights belong to the people. Civil liberties belong to the people. 

Federal agents should not be roaming American streets in masks and arresting people without cause or in violation of their rights.

Federal agents should not enjoy anonymity when they violate the rights of immigrants and U.S. citizens.

Law enforcement agencies should operate with a presumption of transparency and identification--save for some narrow and well justified exceptions. This is how <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2025/12/18/us-masked-federal-agents-undermine-rule-of-law" target="blank">law enforcement builds trust and credibility</a> with the people they police.

Further, accountability demands, at minimum, the ability to identify offenders.

The Trump Administration will no doubt argue this leak threatens the safety of ICE agents. It will probably try to get the site shut down and the data removed.

We'd argue, however, that the best way to protect federal agents is for leaders to ensure they follow the law and respect the rights of their fellow citizens.
